# Project Todo: n8n Workflow Analyzer

## 1. Overall Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop the "n8n-workflow-analyzer," a comprehensive tool designed to process, analyze, and extract actionable insights from a large collection (5000+) of n8n workflow JSON files. This tool aims to uncover common patterns, best practices, and potential inefficiencies within these workflows, thereby providing valuable information for improving workflow design, standardizing automation practices, enhancing training materials, and supporting strategic decision-making.

## 2. Core System Capabilities

The n8n-workflow-analyzer will deliver the following key functionalities:

### 2.1. Workflow Data Ingestion and Management
- [ ] **Efficient Processing:** Implement mechanisms to ingest and parse a large volume of n8n workflow JSON files (targeting 5000+), focusing on memory efficiency (e.g., using generators) and batch processing.
- [ ] **Robust Parsing:** Ensure the system can gracefully handle malformed or incompatible JSON files, logging errors without halting overall processing.
- [ ] **Data Storage:** Set up a persistent storage solution (e.g., PostgreSQL) for processed workflow data and analysis results.
- [ ] **Caching:** Utilize a caching mechanism (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

### 2.2. Workflow Analysis Engine
- [ ] **Structural Parsing:** Extract and interpret core n8n workflow components: nodes (types, names, parameters), connections (source, target, ports), and workflow metadata (name, ID, active status, tags).
- [ ] **Descriptive Analytics:** Calculate and present statistics on node type distributions, workflow complexity metrics (e.g., node count, connection density), and common connection patterns.
- [ ] **Parameter Extraction:** Identify and extract key operational parameters from various node types.

### 2.3. Feature Engineering for Mining
- [ ] **Transactional Transformation:** Convert structured workflow data into a transactional format suitable for pattern mining algorithms.
- [ ] **Feature Creation:** Generate relevant features for analysis, such as:
    - Individual node types.
    - Node type and key parameter combinations (e.g., `httpRequest_method_POST`).
    - Short sequential patterns of connected nodes (node chains).
- [ ] **Encoding:** Prepare data for mining libraries using techniques like one-hot encoding.

### 2.4. Pattern Discovery and Rule Mining
- [ ] **Frequent Pattern Mining:** Employ algorithms like FP-Growth to identify itemsets (node types, node-parameter pairs, sequences) that frequently co-occur across workflows.
- [ ] **Association Rule Learning:** Generate association rules (e.g., X â†’ Y) from frequent itemsets to uncover relationships and predictive insights, along with metrics like support, confidence, and lift.
- [ ] **Advanced Mining (Optional):** Explore sequential pattern mining for ordered events and workflow clustering to group similar workflows.

### 2.5. Graph-Based Network Analysis
- [ ] **Graph Representation:** Model n8n workflows as directed graphs (using libraries like NetworkX), where nodes are vertices and connections are edges.
- [ ] **Structural Metrics:** Calculate and analyze graph metrics such as node centrality (in-degree, out-degree, betweenness), path lengths, and density.
- [ ] **Pattern Identification:** Implement algorithms for common subgraph identification and community detection within workflow graphs.

### 2.6. Statistical Validation
- [ ] **Metric Calculation:** Provide robust calculation for support, confidence, and lift of discovered rules.
- [ ] **Significance Testing:** Incorporate statistical tests (e.g., chi-square, Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons) to validate the significance of found patterns and rules.
- [ ] **Threshold Optimization:** Allow for tuning of parameters like `min_support` for pattern mining.

### 2.7. Interactive Visualization and Reporting (Web Application)
- [ ] **Backend API:** Develop a backend (e.g., Flask) to serve analysis results and handle user requests.
- [ ] **Frontend Interface:** Build a user-friendly web interface (e.g., React) for interacting with the analyzer.
- [ ] **Data Input:** Allow users to upload n8n workflow JSON files (or specify a directory for batch processing).
- [ ] **Interactive Visualizations (D3.js):**
    - Display individual workflow structures graphically.
    - Visualize aggregated network graphs of common patterns.
    - Present statistical charts and graphs for distributions and rule metrics.
    - Implement drill-down capabilities for exploring data at different levels of detail.
- [ ] **Pattern Exploration:** Provide an interface to browse, filter, and sort discovered patterns and association rules.
- [ ] **Reporting:** Enable users to generate and download reports of the analysis findings.
- [ ] **Real-time Updates:** Consider WebSocket integration for progress updates during long analyses.
- [ ] **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.

### 2.8. System Performance and Scalability
- [ ] **Optimization:** Implement performance optimizations for processing large datasets, including parallel processing where applicable.
- [ ] **Scalability Design:** Architect the system to handle growing numbers of workflows and increasing data complexity.
- [ ] **Resource Management:** Monitor and manage memory and CPU usage effectively.

## 3. Key Deliverables
- [ ] A fully functional n8n-workflow-analyzer web application.
- [ ] Comprehensive technical documentation covering architecture, setup, and API.
- [ ] User guide and tutorials for operating the analyzer and interpreting results.
- [ ] Dockerized application for ease of deployment.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Usability:** The tool should be intuitive and easy to use for individuals familiar with n8n.
- [ ] **Maintainability:** Code should be well-structured, commented, and testable.
- [ ] **Extensibility:** The architecture should allow for future enhancements and addition of new analysis modules.
