# Active Context - Current Focus

## Current Mode

**CREATIVE Mode** - COMPLETE â†’ **IMPLEMENT Mode Required**

## Current Phase

All Creative Design Decisions Complete - Ready for Implementation

## Immediate Focus

- [x] Platform Detection (macOS confirmed)
- [x] Basic Memory Bank file creation
- [x] Complete file verification checkpoint
- [x] Complexity determination (LEVEL 3 - Complex System)
- [x] Comprehensive planning document created
- [x] Creative phases identified (Architecture, Algorithm, UI/UX)
- [x] Architecture design decision (Hybrid Pipeline Architecture)
- [x] Algorithm design decision (Enhanced FP-Growth with validation)
- [x] UI/UX design decision (Progressive disclosure interface)

## Context Notes

- Fresh project workspace with minimal structure
- Basic documentation exists (README.md, docs/)
- Memory Bank files being created during VAN initialization
- Ready to proceed to complexity assessment once file verification completes

## Key Files Created

- tasks.md (source of truth)
- projectbrief.md (foundation)
- activeContext.md (this file)

## Next Action

Ready for IMPLEMENT mode - All design decisions complete, ready for code implementation
